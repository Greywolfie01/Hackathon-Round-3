The entire project was created on google cloud, using google cloud shell to edit and make the website. 

All website features (tables and graphs) are scalable according to the input data. 
Functionality was the main priority compared to looks, although an attempt was made for it to be a little good looking. 
The background picture loads on occasion and does not load all the time, not enough time was available to discover why. 
Contact tables are visible only when selected. 
All graphs are responsive. 

This was a overall hard project since it came between a multitude of tests and assignments due to WITS, however the assignment was done to my best ability considering the time constraint.
